// Step 1: Grab the canvas html element with an id game_display and save it to a variable called canvas


// Step 2: Get the canvas rendering context and set it to a variable called ctx

// Step 3: Set the canvas width to 900 and the height to 490


// Step 4: Create a function called draw that takes in ctx as a parameter



// Step 5: Using what you learned, inside of the draw function, instruct canvas to render a square. Use any size and fill style you like!

// Step 6: Now we have a square! Lets get it to move! Replace the x and y parameters in the fillRect() function with the variables xPosition and yPosition (For the first parameter, use xPosition, For the second parameter, use yPosition)

// Use your arrow keys to move the square! Hit the space bar to get it to jump!

// Creating the background canvas

// Step 7: First lets change the size of our square that we set on step 5 to ensure it fits on the level. Set its width and height to be 20 x 20

// Step 8: Grab the canvas html element with an id game_background and save it to a variable called backgroundCanvas


// Step 9: Get the canvas rendering context and set it to a variable called backgroundctx


// Step 10: Set the backgroundCanvas width to 900 and the height to 480
